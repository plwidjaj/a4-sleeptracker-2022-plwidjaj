5. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?



--Aim for no more than two sentences for each of the following questions.--


6. Did you design your app with a particular type of user in mind? If so, whom?

I designed this app for an all ages audience-- therefore I prioritized its simplicity and practically above all else.

7. Did you design your app specifically for iOS or Android, or both?

I designed it in mind for both.

8. How can a person log overnight sleep in your app? Why did you choose to support logging overnight sleep in this way?

They can log overnight sleep by manually inputting their start and end times using an Ionic datetime picker wheel and then pressing confirm. These components are both simple and visually engaging-- all users need to do is scroll and then press a button.

9. How can a person log sleepiness during the day in your app? Why did you choose to support logging sleepiness in this way?

They can log sleepiness by choosing a number from a list and then pressing confirm. Again, it is very simple and intuitive-- something anyone could pick up.


10. How can a person view the data they logged in your app? Why did you choose to support viewing logged data in this way?

The person can view their data by clicking on the view data button for the corresponding data they want to view-- the data is formatted in big cards that include the date at the top and information inside to allow for easy visibility. It is all automatically sorted to show the most recent dates at the top and old dates at the bottom for easy organized viewing.

11. Which feature choose--using a native device resource, backing up logged data, or both?

I chose to back up the logged data using Ionic Storage.

12. If you used a native device resource, what feature did you add? How does this feature change the app's experience for a user?

NA

13. If you backed up logged data, where does it back up to?

It backs up to a local file.

14. How does your app implement or follow principles of good mobile design?

It shows a useful intial view at the start, allowing users to automatically understand all the features and capabilities of the app at once. It also follows platform conventions of both iphone and android by simulating a very similar UI.
